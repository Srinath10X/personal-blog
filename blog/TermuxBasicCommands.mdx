Termux is a great tool that allows us to run linux tools on android which is my go to recommendation to someone who want to learn linux,programming but dosen't have any laptop/desktop and still has a burning desire to learn something but stuck at using this amazing application.

*for those of you who are wondering about my termux-setup. You can find more about it here [link](https://github.com/Srinath10X/termux-setup)*

> Note: Before we dive deeper. I want you to know that learning a programming language or any other topic is about understanding the key concepts and practicing them. You don't need to know everything and no one does. Focus on building a solid foundation, solving problems, and expanding your knowledge step by step 

## Updating,Upgrading and Installing packages
We can update packages in termux using the following command
```bash
apt update
```
> Note: You have to update,upgrade and then update to install packages in termux for some reason there is another update step. The upgrade step is below the installation section

To install any package/packages in termux we use 
```bash
apt install <package-name> <another-package> <another-package> ...
```
we can pass `-y` flag to skip the yes or no confirmation while installing 

For example:
```bash
apt install neovim -y
```
For upgrading packages we can use the following command and I have skipped the yes/no confirmation using `-y` flag at the end
```bash
apt upgrade -y
```
but this will not work as you expected while running first time it asks alot of confirmations so to address this problem I generally use this below command instead
```bash
yes | apt upgrade
```
So I have piped `yes` to the `apt upgrade` command so that it will saves sometime and effort.

I generally update and upgrade packages in termux with this single command
```bash
apt update && yes | apt upgrade 
```
## Navigating,Managing Files and Directories

To know in which directory/folder you are in you can type the following command

```bash
pwd
```
> Note: Most people who are new to programming dosen't understand the term <u>**directory**</u>. It means folder.

Which results in showing this path
```bash
/data/data/com.termux/files/home
```
by default when you open termux you are presented with the `~` sign on the left side of the prompt which indicates that you are in the home folder 
![termux-img](https://github.com/Srinath10X/personal-blog/blob/assets/Blog/termux/pwd.png?raw=true)

Now you know that you are in the home directory/folder lets create file 
```bash
touch <file-name.extension>
```
Example: 
```bash
touch index.html
```
Great you have created a file but how do you know is it created or not. On Linux/macOs/Termux or any other unix like systems we have a command called `ls` to list the files and directories/folders in the current directory/folder
```bash
ls
```
You can able to see the file that we have created

we can also pass some arguments like `-a` to get the hidden/dotfiles which start with`.`
```bash
ls -a
```
![ls](https://github.com/Srinath10X/personal-blog/blob/assets/Blog/termux/create-file.png?raw=true)
Now the whole screen is a little bit messy we can clear the terminal by using `clear` command or `ctrl+l` shortcut

We have created an index.html file but there is nothing in that file to insert data/text into that file we use a terminal-text editor tools like `nano`,`vim`(btw I use neovim) to edit that file. I personally use neovim as my primary text-editor/ide. I will open the file with neovim by typing `nvim index.html` and adding some data 
![neovim-image](https://github.com/Srinath10X/personal-blog/blob/assets/Blog/termux/neovim-coding-html.png?raw=true)

To see what inside a specific file we don't need to use an editor we can also use a program called `cat` 
```bash
cat file-name
```
Example:
```bash
cat index.html
```
![cat-html](https://github.com/Srinath10X/personal-blog/blob/assets/Blog/termux/cat-html.png?raw=true)
As we write more programs the home folder gonna be messy we can organize the home directory by creating directories/folders for different usecases

So to create a folder in Termux we use command `mkdir <folder-name>` and to delete `rmdir <folder-name>`
![folder](https://github.com/Srinath10X/personal-blog/blob/assets/Blog/termux/mkdir.png?raw=true)

So lets create a folder name web by `mkdir web` and to change the directory (I mean to enter into the directory that we have created ).We use `cd` command 
```bash
cd <folder-name>
```
To navigate back a level from that folder we use 
```bash
cd ..
```
for multiple levels we use `cd ../../..`. So we have created a folder named web let again go to that folder by typing `cd web` and then I will create a file named `index.html` or any other file of you choice it may be `main.cpp` or `main.py` as of your choice

> Note: I am showing this `index.html` as an example to organize the folders.
Okay how can we copy files and directories from one path to another path

We have a command called `cp` to copy files to a specified path `cp <file-name> <path>`
```bash
cp index.html web/
```
> Note: we can use `/` or we can leave it 

The above command is copying the index.html file to the web/ directory 
So we have copied the index.html file into the web directory we can check that by running `ls web/`
![cp-command](https://github.com/Srinath10X/personal-blog/blob/assets/Blog/termux/cp-command.png?raw=true)
Now we know that how to copy a file into a directory but how can we copy a directory to another directory we can archive that by adding `-r`flag to the cp command `cp -r <folder-name> <path-to-another-folder>`. First I will create an empty directory in the home directory by typing `mkdir empty` and copy that empty directory into web directory by typing
```bash
cp -r empty web
```
And the last and final command in this list is `mv` we can move instead of copying the command
